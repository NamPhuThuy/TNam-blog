This lab lesson is design for 3 people:
- Person 1 as the team leader
- Person 2, 3 as the team members

# Part 1: 
## Create repo
Person 1: Create a new github repo with these things:
- **Public** repository
- Default **README file**
- A **.gitignore template** for **C++**
- **MIT license**

Person 1: Add collaborators
- Settings -> Collaborators -> Add people

Person 2, 3: Accept invitation
- Press the **notifications button** next to the left of avatar
- Accept the invitation as collaborator of Person 1

## Clone repo from remote into local
2 ways:
- Navigate to the desired folder: 
  - git clone
  
- Create a local repository and connect to the remote repository: 
  - git init, git remote

## Working simultaneously
Person 1, 2, 3: 
- Each person creates branch with this format: **<person_name>_task** (example: nam_task, kien_task)
  ```
  git branch, git checkout, git switch
  ```
- Each person made their own **commits**
  ```
  git add, git commit
  ```
- Each person pushes their works to the **remote repo**
  ```
  git push
  ```

## Merge works
Person 1: 
- Pull the branches of 2 other people into person1's local repo
  ```
  git fetch, git pull
  ```

- Merge 3 people works into main
  ```
  git merge
  ```
